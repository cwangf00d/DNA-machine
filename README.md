# DNA-machine

This was part of a project I completed both in my own time and in my AP Computer Science A class.  I created a program, through object-oriented programming, that is able to read big data samples of nucleotide sequences and gather information from them. Some features include an ability to transcribe and translate, find certain DNA sequences, locate repeating polymorphisms, and etc.  

## Getting Started

I created this program on an IDE, specifically an Eclipse IDE with Java, so if you wish to run this code on your local machine, make sure to install the latest version of Java and Eclipse SE IDE.  To run this program, you only need to download and move these files into your workspace and open them as a new project.

### Prerequisites

You should install Eclipse and Java to run this program most effectively.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

The program comes with its own built in tests in the DNA01 program, so if you just run that, you will be able to test each section of the code.
